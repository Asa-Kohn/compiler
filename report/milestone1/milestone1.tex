\section{Design and Implementation Decisions}

\subsection{Rationale of implementation tools chosen}

The first milestone as well as subsequent ones have and will be written in C
using flex and bison. Given that we all used this in prior coursework, it made
sense to go down this path of implementation tools. In the sections
that follow, we will detail the implementation decisions undertaken for each
component of our GoLite compiler required for this milestone.

\subsection{Scanning}
% Multiline comments (match)

Most of the scanning implementation was the same as that in the assignments
earlier in the semester. Given that GoLite has more keywords and built-in
features than MiniLang, there was of course more to account and scan for.

Multiline comments were a point of discussion and work on. We ended up deciding
to match the first \verb|/*| with the first occurence of the closing token \verb|*/|
for the comment block, as GoLite does not support nested comments.
This was implemented using an elegant regular expression:

\[
    \verb|\/\*[^\*]*\*+([^\*\/][^\*]*\*+)*\/|
\]

As far as our testing goes, it appears to be functional.

For semicolon insertion rules, we decided to keep track of the last token prior
to seeing any of the tokens found in the insertion rules. This can be found in
the Go language documentation \cite{gosemi}.

% is there anything else?

\subsection{Parsing}

In order to parse functions, we decided to segregate those with no arguments and
those with non-zero arguments as different rules in the grammar.
This allowed for better legibility and hopefully
causes less issues when it comes to grammar rules which could result in
unwanted grammar productions. For the functions calls, we used the
\verb|%nonassoc| pragma on the \verb|(| and \verb|[| tokens. We gave this the
highest precedence as this needs to be considered first.
It appears as if that this could also be completed using
the \verb|%right| pragma, although it didn't
seem as elegant and appeared to be more work to implement correctly.

We decided to defer the verification of the blank specifier in the type checking
phase of the compiler.

\subsection{Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)}

The AST was chosen to be quite simple and we used interleaving as our method
of implementation. It follows the same structure as the assignment although
there were a couple of differences as to what Alex and Will had done in their
respective solo assignments. In this part we decided to create many C structures
in order to keep the different kind of node types separated. The \verb|else if|
linking follows more of what Asa had done in his assignment. This actually helped
immensely when it came to coding up the pretty printer as the structure of
the AST was sound (after we sorted out all the kinks).

\subsection{Pretty Printing}

Thankfully, a lot of the boilerplate code for pretty printing from the notes
and the second assignment was used for this milestone. Given the very rich
structure of the AST design (modulo the ``back and forth'' of design choice
changes), writing the pretty printer was rather straight forward.

\subsection{Implementation difficulties encountered}

When working through this milestone, we realized that declarations can have
arbitrarily long variables and values. This means that there does not exist
a fixed $k$ such that the parser is $LR(k)$. Thus, we decided to make it a GLR
parser and with some work, the issues seemed to work themselves out.

Designing the AST posed some issues as well. There were a couple of periods  of
``back and forth'' where something that we thought would fix an issue did not
and vice versa. Examples of this includes how to organize expression lists. We
decided on one way to do it, which we then agreed to fix after this milestone
as time until submission was rapidly approaching.

Given the back and forth nature of our progress, this set us back progressing
in other parts of the compiler components required for this milestone, as we'd
have to change the code written based on the new structure of some components of
the AST nodes.

Finally, time constraints induced some challenges and late nights.

\section{Division of labour and team organization}

\subsection{Dividing the work}

We'd like to note that everyone in the group contributed equal amounts of
respective work and time. We also all did testing together.

\subsubsection{Asa}

% lexer, parser
Asa was mainly in charge with writing most of the lexer and parser, although
decisions and discussions were done as a group. He also spearheaded the AST part
of the compiler, although we all decided together how to implement certain
intracacies that presented themselves. Given that Asa did most of the structure
of core components of the compiler, other group members had to rely on his ideas
on how he thought components further down in the pipeline should be implemented.

\subsubsection{Will}

% programs, general, etc

Will had written half of programs (both valid and invalid ones) to be
submitted for this milestone. He did some testing to make sure that the code was
correct and debated on what were `interesting' valid programs with Alex.
He was responsible for organizing that part of the project to confirm it
met the specifications of the first milestone.

\subsubsection{Alex}

Alex was mostly in charge with writing programs and verifying the work of
others. This included going over the bison source code file in an attempt to discover
\textit{elegant} ways of writing the required grammar for GoLite. He also took
charge in organizing the work and being in charge of keeping the repository in check.
By keeping the repository `in check' we mean that what has to be accomplished is
(or attempts to be) well established within the repository. This also includes
making sure
that everything is done as properly as possible. Finally, taking charge
of making pull requests and merging is a part of this task.

Alex also did most of the pretty printing, which was of course verified and
discussed with the other members of the group.

\subsection{Organization}

In order to be productive, we decided to set up certain communication channels.
This was done using \href{https://matrix.org/}{Matrix} which is an open source
alternative to Slack. Further, some markdown files were created to do basic
TODO lists, but given the time frame, it wasn't as successful -- each team
member had their own list of things to focus on instead.

We also met quite frequently as the deadline for submission approached, this
includes the time of writing this report as we all work together in Burnside
basement.
