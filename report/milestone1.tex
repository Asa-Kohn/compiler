\section{Design and Implementation Decisions}

\subsection{Rationale of implementation tools chosen}

The first milestone as well as subsequent ones have and will be written in C
using flex and bison. Given that we all used this in prior coursework, it made
sense to go down this path of implementation tools. In the sections
that follow, we will detail the implementation decisions undertaken for each
component of our GoLite compiler required for this milestone.

\subsection{Scanning}
% Multiline comments (match)

Most of the scanning implementation was the same as that in the assignments earlier in the semester. Given that GoLite has more keywords and built-in features than MiniLang, there were of course more to account and scan for.

Multiline comments were a point of discussion and work on. We ended up deciding to match the first \verb|\*| the first occurence of the closing token \verb|*/| for the comment block, as GoLite does not support nested comments. This was implemented using an elegant regular expression:

\[
    \verb|\/\*[^\*]*\*+([^\*\/][^\*]*\*+)*\/|
\]

As far as our testing goes, it appears to be functional.

\subsection{Parsing}
% function parsing when there are 0 and 1+ args
% func name () <--- %noassoc pragma

In order to parse functions, we decided to segregate those with no arguments and those with non-zero arguments as different rules in the grammar.

% expression list when it has zero elements?

% semi colon insertion (keep track of the last token)

% chat with Asa

\subsection{Implementation difficulties encountered}

Thankfully, there was not much difficulty in implementation as far as we can tell, but time constraints induced some difficulties.

\section{Division of labour and team organization}

\subsection{Dividing the work}
% speak to each individual so that I know exactly what they did

\subsubsection{Asa}

% lexer, parser
Asa was mainly in charge with writing most (if not all) of the lexer and parser; this task was done with Will and Alex.

\subsubsection{Will}

% programs, general, etc/

Will had written most of the programs (both valid and invalid ones) to be
submitted for this milestone, he did some testing to make sure that the code was good and debated on `interesting' valid programs with Alex.

\subsubsection{Alex}

% parser verification
% pretty printing (possibly) + testing?

Alex was mostly in charge with writing programs and verifying the work of
others. This included going over the bison source code file in an attempt to discover
\textit{elegant} ways of writing the required grammar for GoLite. He also took
charge in organizing work and being in charge of keeping the repository in check.
By keeping the repository `in check' we mean that what has to be accomplished is
(or attempts to be) well established within the repository, as well as make sure
that everything is done as properly as possible. This also includes taking charge of making pull requests and merging.

% Talk about testing once that actually gets done.

\subsection{Organization}

% mention what tools we use to be productive, etc
% how often we met etc

In order to be productive, we decided to set up certain communication channels.
This was done using \href{Matrix}{https://matrix.org/} which is an open source
alternative to Slack. Further, some Markdown files were created to do basic
TODO lists, but given the time frame, it wasn't as successful -- each team
member had their own list of things to focus on instead on their local devices.
