### Special Instructions

We got PyPy installed on mimi via Corey at CS help, however it is PyPy3 that is required for codegen testing in `execute.sh`.
If you could please install that on whichever machine you are grading on if possible, that would be appreciated.

`execute.sh` current has `python3 ${1%.go}.py`, if PyPy3 has been installed, modify that line to `pypy3 ${1%.go}.py`.
